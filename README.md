# Nate's Usefull Scripts 
This repo is a collection of usefull scripts I have written when the need arose

## Main2Master
This script changes the default branch name of a git repo from main to master. This is usefull for an older codebase that still uses the legacy term master for their default branch name. This script is intended to be used with a git repo managed by github and therefore involves the extra step of swaping the default branch in the github ui. This step involves naviagting to the settings tab of a github repo which can be easily done by clicking the link provided when running the script. 

## Master2Main
This script changes the default branch name of a git repo from master to main. This is usefull for an older codebase that used the legacy term master for it's default branch name and now wants to update to the new default main. This script is intended to be used with a git repo managed by github and therefore involves the extra step of swaping the default branch in the github ui. This step involves naviagting to the settings tab of a github repo which can be easily done by clicking the link provided when running the script. 

## PullAll
This script is used to pull the latest code for all git repos within a specified folder. To use this script edit the text `PATH_TO_BASE_FOLDER` with your path to the base folder.
